# SP23-Gesture-Elicitation-Using-Open-Brush

Open Brush is a free fork of Tilt Brush, a room-scale 3D-painting virtual-reality application available from Google, originally developed by Skillman & Hackett. Our group from CSU deployed the application and came with improved ways to ease the use of base brush by creating custom brushes that can be implemented by users not wanting to use the base brush.
